Shopify's Frontend Challenge (Spacestagram)

## Website Link
https://aryan-thakur.github.io/shopify-frontend-challenge/

## Features
I have added in an animated like button, a loading screen overlay and date picker
to choose which date the images must be shown from.

Please Note: dev-run.py file is a file that I use to open up a development server. The main
code for the website is in the app folder. I have used the AngularJS framework for the entire
development of this application.

Fun fact: This was made from scratch in approximately 2 hours.
